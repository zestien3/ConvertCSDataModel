# ConvertCSDataModel

This tool simply converts a record defined in C# (dotnet) and outputs it in TypeScript format.

It uses Reflection to do so, using the MetadataReader written in net8.0

As a tool it might not be that interesting to everyone, but if you want to get started using the MetadataReader, it might be helpfull.
